### Hey hi hello! ✌️

I'm Andy! I enjoy being a tinkerer - building cool projects and breaking even cooler projects (oops 😁). Also highly skilled in the sophisticated art of writing _only the finest_ for-loops, of course.

### About me 🤓

- Graduated from CS'22 at UWaterloo 🦆 - previously SE'22
- Playing **a lot** of badminton 🏸 at UWBC
- Cat 🐈 lover! Adopting some very fluffy cats soon
